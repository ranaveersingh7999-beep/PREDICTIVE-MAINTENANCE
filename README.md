Predictive Maintenance                                                           
This project focuses on building an early warning system to predict equipment failures, allowing for scheduled maintenance and minimizing costly unplanned downtime. This is a critical application of data science in the logistics and manufacturing sector, directly impacting operational efficiency (OPEX).
